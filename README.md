`caterpillar` is a hardened HLS merger. It takes an HTTP Live Streaming VOD URL (typically an .m3u8 URL), downloads the video segments, and attempts to merge them into a single, coherent file. It is specially designed to combat timestamp discontinuities (symptom: a naive FFmpeg run spews tons of "Non-monotonous DTS in output stream" warning messages and ends up with a useless file with completely broken timestamps).

`caterpillar` supports [up to version 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8216#section-7) of the HTTP Live Streaming protocol (VOD only; non-VOD playlists are treated as VOD, and may result in unexpected consequences).

## Dependencies

  -j JOBS, --jobs JOBS  maximum number of concurrent downloads (default is
                        twice the number of CPU cores, including virtual
                        cores)
  -v, --verbose         increase logging verbosity (can be specified multiple
                        times)
